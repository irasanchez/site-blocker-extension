This is a fork of the **Strict Pomodoro Chrome Extension** by [Matchu](https://github.com/matchu).

Main features that have not (at least for now) been merged into the main repository:

* Bigger default blocklist (includes pinterest, tumblr, and others)
* Simpler icon states (just two distinct icons instead of four)
* Options page more similar to Chrome settings pages
* Prettier message for blocked pages

You can download it at: [github.com/dmfrancisco/Strict-Pomodoro/downloads](https://github.com/dmfrancisco/Strict-Pomodoro/downloads)  
Just drag the downloaded file into the extensions page (go to *Tools > Extensions* or paste *chrome://chrome/extensions/* in the address bar).

Includes optional desktop notifications, which have not yet been added by the author to the Chrome Web Store version.
